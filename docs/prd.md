## 4. Functional Requirements (Features)

The website will be a statically generated site built with Next.js and will consist of the following pages and features:

### 4.1. Global Elements

### 4.5. Project Detail Page (`/projects/[id]`)
*   **Purpose:** To provide an in-depth look at a specific project.
*   **Content:** Project title, detailed description, technologies used, links to the live demo and source code repository, and images or screenshots.

## 6. Data Management

All portfolio content (personal info, projects, experience, skills) will be managed via static TypeScript files located in the `/data` directory. This allows for version control of content and easy updates through code, without the need for an external CMS.
